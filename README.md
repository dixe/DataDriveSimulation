# A simple physics simulation to try data driven design

## Game design

A simple simpulation with at free moving camera




# Goals
* [ ] Ground plane and support for plane/box walls
* [x] Simulation of ball that can bounce. Like pool


## Extra goals
* [ ] load initial setup from a file. Like ball initial position and velocity
* [ ] Support for gravety and sloped planes. Maybe also support angular momentum, to make balls travel correctly in a half pipe
